# Slug Language

**Slug** is a small, opinionated programming language built for **readability**, **explicit control flow**, and *
*predictable behavior**—with a **functional core** and **structured concurrency**.

## What Slug is about

- **Functional-first** programming: first-class functions, pattern matching, and data-first pipelines
- **Explicit concurrency**: structured concurrency with clear `spawn` / `await` semantics
- **Minimal surface area**: a compact syntax, a small standard library, and clear defaults over “magic”
- **Predictable modules**: straightforward modules and deterministic initialization

## Quick links

- **Website / Getting started:** https://sluglang.org
- **Main repo:** `slug`
- **Docs:** developer guide, setup guide, cookbook, and ADRs live in the repo’s `docs/` directory

## Status

Slug is actively developed and used in real projects. Expect rapid iteration while features stabilize (including
occasional breaking changes).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome—especially around tooling, documentation, examples, and standard library
ergonomics. If you’re not sure where to start, open an issue describing what you want to build and we’ll help you find a
good entry point.
